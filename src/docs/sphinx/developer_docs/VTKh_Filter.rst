VTK-h Filter Anatomy
====================
VTK-h filters can be found in the ``src/vtkh/filters`` directory of the
`VTK-h github repsository <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/vtk-h>`_.
The VTK-h filter interface is straight-forward:

.. code-block:: c++

  public:
    Filter();
    virtual ~Filter();
    void SetInput(DataSet *input);
    virtual std::string GetName() const = 0;
    DataSet* GetOutput();
    DataSet* Update();

  protected:
    virtual void DoExecute() = 0;
    virtual void PreExecute();
    virtual void PostExecute();

A new VTK-h filter must minimally implement two methods: ``GetName()`` and ``DoExecute``.
A filter's input is a VTK-h data set which is a collection (a std::vector)  of VTK-m data set
with extra meta data like the cycle and domain ids.

Implementing A New Filter
-------------------------
As a convenience, we provide a `NoOp <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/vtk-h/blob/develop/src/vtkh/filters/NoOp.hpp>`_
filter as staring point. Its recommended that you copy and rename the header and source code
files and use that as a base. The NoOp filter demonstrates how to loop through all the domains
in the input data set, retrieve the underlying VTK-m data set, and where the interesting stuff
goes.

.. code-block:: c++

  void NoOp::DoExecute()
  {
    this->m_output = new DataSet();
    const int num_domains = this->m_input->GetNumberOfDomains();

    for(int i = 0; i < num_domains; ++i)
    {
      vtkm::Id domain_id;
      vtkm::cont::DataSet dom;
      this->m_input->GetDomain(i, dom, domain_id);
      // insert interesting stuff
      m_output->AddDomain(dom, domain_id);
    }
  }

Inside of the source file, you are free to create new and invoke existing VTK-m worklets that will
execute on supported devices. For a more fully functional example, consult the `Marching Cubes <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/vtk-h/blob/develop/src/vtkh/filters/MarchingCubes.cpp>`_
filter.

Updating the CMakeLists.txt
---------------------------
Once you have copied the header and source file, add the new file names to the CMakeLists file in
the filters directory. The header should be added to the ``vtkh_filters_headers`` list and the
source file to the ``vtkh_filters_sources`` list.

Using MPI Inside VTK-h
----------------------
VTK-h and Ascent both create two separate libraries for MPI and non-MPI (i.e., serial).
In order to maintain the same interface for both versions of the library, ``MPI_Comm`` handles
are represented by integers and are converted to the MPI implementations underlying representation
by using the ``MPI_Comm_f2c`` function.

Code containing calls to MPI are protected by the define ``VTKH_PARALLEL`` and calls to MPI API calls
must be guarded inside the code. Here is an example.

.. code-block:: c++

    #ifdef VTKH_PARALLEL
      MPI_Comm mpi_comm = MPI_Comm_f2c(vtkh::GetMPICommHandle());
      int rank;
      MPI_Comm_rank(comm, &rank);
    #endif

.. note::
    ``vtkh::GetMPICommHandle()`` will throw an exception if called outside of a ``VTKH_PARALLEL``
    block.
